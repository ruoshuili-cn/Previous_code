# My revious code

Since Oct. 2017, when I became an undergraduate reserach assistant, I have been working intensively at the intersection of **Environmental Science** / **Power and Renewables**, and **Data science**. My works include:
- Preliminary data cleansing and data manipulation;
- Creating algorithms to implement computing models of environment specialty (e.g. *Environmental Multi-region input-output (MRIO) model, Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model*); 
- Exploratory data analysis;
- Data Visualization;

I shared several codes in the repository for the reference of any people interested in them. 

Feel free to contact me (ruoshui.li@hotmail.com) if you have any questions.
